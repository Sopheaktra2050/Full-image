			   <p> The concept of landscape (extension of terrain seen from a place or site) is used differently by several fields of study, although all the uses of the term imply the existence of an observing subject (the one that visualizes ) and of an observed object (the ground), of which its visual, spatial qualities stand out fundamentally.

The landscape, from the geographical point of view, is the primary object of study and the basic geographical document from which geography is made. In general, landscape is understood as any area of ​​the earth's surface resulting from the interaction of the different factors present in it and that have a visual reflection in space. The geographical landscape is therefore the aspect acquired by the geographical space. The landscape, from the artistic point of view, especially pictorial, is the graphic representation of an extensive terrain. With the same meaning the term country is used (it should not be confused with the political concept of country). The landscape can also be the material object to be created or modified by art itself.

In literature, the description of the landscape is a literary form called topography (a term that also gives name to topography as a science and technique used for the graphic representation of the earth's surface). In literary constructions and essays it is usual to compare the landscape with the peasantry (of paisano), that is to say, the medium with the human groups. </p>
